# Diversity & Inclusion at Auralis 🌍

At Auralis, we believe that building a great company starts with building a welcoming one.

We’re committed to creating an inclusive environment where everyone—regardless of background, identity, or ability—can thrive, contribute, and be heard.

## 🌈 What We Believe

- **Diversity makes us better.** Different backgrounds bring different perspectives. That’s how we challenge assumptions, spark creativity, and build better products.
- **Inclusion is active.** It’s not enough to “be welcoming.” We continuously work to create processes, culture, and habits that help everyone feel like they truly belong.
- **Representation matters.** We want our team to reflect the world we’re building for—and we know we still have work to do.

## 👥 What We’re Doing

- Remote-first culture that supports flexibility and accessibility  
- Bias-aware hiring process focused on skills, not pedigrees  
- Transparent salaries and clear career progression  
- Psychological safety and honest feedback culture  
- No tolerance for discrimination or harassment, ever

## 💬 A Note to Candidates

If you're unsure whether you'd “fit in” here—apply anyway. We’re not looking for culture fit, we’re looking for **culture add**.

We value curiosity, kindness, and the drive to build something meaningful. If that sounds like you, we’d love to meet you.
